They can afford it.<p>If they really cared (e.g. they perceived it hurt their business) they would have used market mechanisms and moved their business out.<p>What makes the SB50 result predictable is that ordinary homeowners benefit from the situation.  (e.g. they can someday rent out or sell their house at an inflated price while paying low property taxes.)  Homeowners vote more than renters,  and importantly,  the people who might move to CA if housing were more available don&#x27;t vote.<p>Another way of thinking about it is that CA is crazy crowded anyway.  I&#x27;m thinking of a neighborhood in Santa Monica where people live in pretty little single family homes with pretty little yards,  well tended gardens.<p>In a place like that,  people are very affected by what their neighbors are doing and they don&#x27;t want more.<p>CA&#x27;s style of development is also expensive economically and environmentally.

Additionally, it&#x27;s not evenly distributed over the building, but cantilevered out.<p>That said, I agree with you that it&#x27;s likely to be trimmed for aesthetic reasons well before it becomes a structural issue; which is why the annual carbon offset claimed is misleading - it assumes the biomass increases annually without intervention.",22183622,

Of course, especially bad stuff tends to eventually get flagged and HN moderation is generally good at keeping things under control, but many of these threads seem to attract people with a specific view (not calling anyone out in particular, different threads will attract different groups and create echo chambers,  as does anywhere in the internet) who will mass downvote what they oppose andunkike other threads, wll constructed comments cant wind up greyed out at the bottom and highly disingenuous ones at the top. I suppose the worst of these threads deal with things that may not neccesarily against the rules, but lower the quality regardless. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see seemingly suspicious unsourced claims and stats upvoted if they confirm existing biases, for example,  while this seems to be less common in other types of threads",22201137,"[22203369, 22201275]"

22201204,comment,rikroots,1580475085,"I added quaternions to my Javascript canvas library. They scared the heck out of me - I coded up the functions from scratch in JS, partly to try and &#x27;understand&#x27; the concepts behind quaternions, but mainly because I was stupid and over-confident. I am not a math&#x2F;physics genius!<p>I doubt using the concept of rotors in place of quaternions would&#x27;ve made my experience any better. It&#x27;s not the concepts that really frighten me - I can read about them and nod my head, pretending that the information is somehow sinking into my brain; the things that scared me were the equations which, the article implies, are pretty much the same.<p>In the end, the things (seem to) work as intended in my library, and I can now sleep at night knowing I&#x27;ll never have to revisit quaternions (or rotors) again in my life.",22201036,
